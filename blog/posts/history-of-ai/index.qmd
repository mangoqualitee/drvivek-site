Attempting to systematically study the history of any human endeavour is an intellectual hurdle which hides in it a humoungous potential and bears through it a sweet fruit of truth. Such an activity bears flexibility of thought, it sows seeds for lays bare detailed insights and more than any other benefit, it gives strength. But this activity is difficult. To attempt a study of a subject's evolution is difficult. This more than any other subject, is more so the case with Artificial Intelligence which by its nature spans and crosses so many disciplines that in my opinion no other subject pursuid by humans does. The reason for this is clear. Artificial Intelligence begins at the inate experience of every human being. It starts with that hopelessness of reasoning the experienced reality and ends today at the most colourful intersection of most advanced of human technologies. It crosses border between disciplines, by approach from nueroscience, philosophy and in application from mathematics to biology. Thus it is a tremendous task to attempt studying the history of such an intricate subject. Am I attempting to do such a thing? I do not know. Right now not. Right now, the following document only contains the most curious of happenstances and outlines the outline of the developments of a Giant of a human endeavour. Right now, the following documents only contains an *Outline* of the evolution of the field of Artificial Intelligence.

# Outline Summary {.unnumbered}

The current outline is mostly a product of my reaserach of the topic of this article(?). Most of the inspiration for this outline right now, comes from [the-wikipedia-article] on this subject. The *AIM* of this currently is to be comprehensive and historically accurate foundation for an eventual article(?) on AI history.

## Brief Remarks on the Outline {.unnumbered}

**Key Decisions Made:**

1. **Precursors Section**: The structure from [the-wikipedia-article] revealed I had underemphasized the rich mythological and fictional foundations of AI. So, I have updated outline now with ancient myths (Greek Talos, Jewish Golem), medieval legends, and modern fiction that shaped AI imagination.

2. **Periodization**: [the-wikipedia-article] refined the chronology of the Outline. The "Birth of AI" period (1941-1956) now properly includes wartime computing advances, and I've separated the later periods more clearly.

3. **Institutional Context**: The details from [the-lesswrong-blog]. I have added more sections about specific research centers and their approaches (Stanford logic, MIT anti-logic, Edinburgh), which provides important context for understanding how different AI schools of thought developed.

4. **Market and Commercial Aspects**: [the-wikipedia-article] emphasizes the commercial dimension thourougly. I've now included in the outline sections for details about AI companies, market cycles, and the business side of AI development.

5. **Recent Recognition**: I've added a section on 2024 Nobel Prizes - it shows AI's achievement of scientific respectability and recognition at the highest levels.

**Structural Decisions Worth Noting:**

- Wikipedia uses broader periods with more overlap, while my original outline was more strictly chronological
- Wikipedia emphasizes the cyclical nature of AI development (winters and booms) more explicitly
- The Wikipedia structure shows how AI "went behind the scenes" during winters, continuing to develop within other fields
- Recent developments are given more weight, reflecting AI's current prominence

**Depth vs Breadth Trade-offs:**

Right now, the outline maintains more technical depth in areas like specific algorithms and theoretical foundations, while [the-wikipedia-article] structure is more accessible to general readers. For the article, I am considering audience targeting to decide on the appropriate level of technical detail for each section.

Finally here is the **Outline**:
