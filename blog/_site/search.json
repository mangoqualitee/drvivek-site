    "text": "The Challenge of Intermittency\nRenewable energy sources like solar and wind are inherently variable:\n\nSolar power generation drops at night and during cloudy weather\nWind power fluctuates based on atmospheric conditions\nBoth can experience seasonal variations in output\n\nThis intermittency creates a fundamental mismatch between energy supply and demand, potentially leading to grid instability and reliability issues. Energy storage provides the solution to this challenge by:\n\nStoring excess energy during high production periods\nReleasing stored energy during low production or high demand periods\nSmoothing out fluctuations to maintain grid stability"
